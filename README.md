# Vivino wine analysis repository

## About
This SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Mini-Project analyses data from [Vivino Wine Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/budnyak/wine-rating-and-price). For the best walkthrough experience, we recommend viewing the notebooks in the following order:
1. [Data Preparation and EDA](https://github.com/KuroZenon/Data-Analysis-of-Wine-Quality/blob/main/notebooks/Data%20Preparation%20and%20EDA.ipynb)
2. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/KuroZenon/Data-Analysis-of-Wine-Quality/blob/main/notebooks/Machine%20Learning.ipynb)


## Problem Definition
- How do different variables affect the price of wine (red, white, ros√©, sparkling)?
- Are we able to predict the price of wine based on its characteristics?
- Which model most accurately predicts the price of wine?


## Models used
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
4. Neural Network


### Notebook 1 Data Preparation and EDA

In this notebook, we combined the wine data from our datasets and proceeded to clean the data. Subsequently, we conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis and discovered that Rating was the factor with the strongest correlation with Price.  We decided to perform np.log() on the Prices as Price was heavily skewed to the right, which improved the correlation of price with our predictors. One-hot Encoding was used to encode Country data as Country is a categorical variable.

### Notebook 2 Machine Learning

The 4 above-mentioned models were utilised for univariate and multivariate analysis. We found that Random Forest Regressor yielded the best Explained Variance (R^2) of 0.8 and that is the model we recommend our users for prediction.

## Conclusion
- Rating is the main feature as it has the strongest correlation with Price
- Age as a factor is typically significant only for red wines due to the properties of its components, hence there is a moderately low correlation with Price when the dataset contains multiple types of wines
- Focusing on time periods rather than individual years may prove more meaningful in the context of wine aging
- Country has a moderate correlation with Price, but top wine-producing countries may have less obvious differences.
- When there are more predictors included, there is a generally more accurate prediction despite low correlations of individual variables
- Generally, all models did moderately well in prediction of wine price, with Random Forest Regressor yielding the best results
